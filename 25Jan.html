                    Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Sikh family on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in
                    the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the
                    second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan
                    Singh Sandhu.<br /> Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive
                    politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the
                    Ghadar Movement of 1914-1915
